# What is dart ? 
Dart is a statically typed programming language, which means that you have to declare the type of a variable when you declare it. Here are some of the most common data types in Dart:

## Variables in Dart

In Dart, a variable is a named memory location that can hold a value of a specific data type. Variables are used to store data that can be used and manipulated throughout a program.

### Here's an example of declaring a variable in Dart: 

String name = "John";

In this example, we declared a variable named name of type String and assigned it the value "John".

### When naming variables in Dart, there are some rules that you need to follow:

Variable names must start with a letter or an underscore (_).
Variable names cannot start with a number.
Variable names can contain letters, numbers, and underscores (_).
Variable names are case-sensitive, which means that name and Name are two different variables.
Variable names should be descriptive and meaningful.


### Here are some examples of valid variable names in Dart:

String name = "John";

int age = 25;

double temperature = 98.6;

bool isStudent = true;

List<String> fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange'];
 
Note that it's common practice to use camel case when naming variables in Dart, where the first word is lowercase and the subsequent words start with a capital letter (e.g., isStudent, fruits).


## Datatypes in Dart

### Numbers:

int: represents integers (whole numbers) with no fractional part
 
double: represents floating-point numbers with a fractional part

### Strings:

represents a sequence of characters enclosed in single or double quotes.

### Booleans:

represents a true or false value.
### Lists:

represents an ordered collection of objects.

Lists can be typed or untyped.
 
### Maps:

represents a collection of key-value pairs where each key is unique.
Sets:

represents a collection of unique objects.
 ### Here's an example of how you can declare variables with different data types:

int age = 25;
 
double temperature = 98.6;
 
String name = "John";
 
bool isStudent = true;
 
List<String> fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange'];
 
Map<String, int> grades = {'math': 90, 'science': 85, 'history': 92};
 
Set<int> numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
