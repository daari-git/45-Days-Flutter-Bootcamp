  #### Note :  Write the same program in for loop, while loop and do..while loop
  
  ### Questions:

 ## Functions in Dart
 
  ### Due Date :  10th May, 2023
  
  
  ### Questions: 
  
      1. Write a function that takes two numbers as a arguments and return the sum of the numbers passed. Store the reutrn value in a variable and print the value that variable has. 
      
      2. Write an arrow function to return the square of the number passed and print the value returned by function storing in variable
      
      3. Create an anonymous function that have to have 2 parameters which are integers. that sums the 2 number passed 
      
      4. Write a function that checks if the number passed is even, odd, negative or zero. 
      
      5. Write a higher order function that accepts the numbers and prints the sum of the number until the number becomes zero. ( eg. if a number is passed is 6 then 6+5+4+3+2+1 is what needs to be printed ). Hint :  use the recursive higher order function
