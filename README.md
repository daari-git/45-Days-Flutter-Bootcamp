## String Datatype

In Dart, a string is a sequence of characters, represented using the String datatype. Here are some examples of declaring and initializing string variables in Dart:

// Initializing a string variable with a string literal
String message = "Hello, world!";

// Initializing a string variable using string interpolation
String name = "Alice";
int age = 30;
String greeting = "Hello, my name is $name and I'm $age years old."; 



String firstName = "Bob";
String lastName = "Smith";
String fullName = firstName + " " + lastName; 

In Dart, strings can also be created using single or double quotes, and can contain escape sequences to represent special characters:

// Using single quotes to create a string
String singleQuotes = 'This string uses single quotes.';

// Using double quotes to create a string
String doubleQuotes = "This string uses double quotes.";

// Using escape sequences to represent special characters
String escapeSequences = "This string contains a newline\nand a tab character\t.";

Dart also provides several built-in methods for working with strings, such as toUpperCase(), toLowerCase(), substring(), indexOf(), and replaceAll().

In Dart, there are several numerical datatypes that can be used to represent different kinds of numbers. Here are the most commonly used numerical datatypes in Dart:

int: represents whole numbers (integers) such as -10, 0, and 42. In Dart, the int datatype is a 64-bit integer.

double: represents floating-point numbers such as 3.14, -0.25, and 1.0e-5. In Dart, the double datatype is a 64-bit floating-point number.

num: represents any kind of number, whether it is an integer or a floating-point number. In Dart, the num datatype can hold any integer or floating-point number.
